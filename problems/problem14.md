## \[Medium\]

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x² + y² = r².

### Calculations

x² + y² = r²
A = πr²
A = π(x² + y²)
π = A/(x² + y²)
