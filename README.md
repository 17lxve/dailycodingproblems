# README

I used to do some of these daily coding problems, but consistency eventually became a problem.
I have decided to it publicly this time and will write code mainly in Python and JS.
If I find the will, I will also do them in Java, C#, and Ruby
As I will also post the problem, feel free to do them with me!

## Advice

Actually do the problems.
This means writing the code and making it run. Getting stuck can be frustrating, but it's natural and the best way to learn.
Time yourself. Candidates who solve interview problems quickly are more likely to cinch the interview.
Think of edge cases and run your code through them. Some good edge cases might be the empty case, weird inputs, or a really large input.
Once you've made sure your code passes all your tests, try explaining your algorithm to a colleague or friend.
You could also start a mini-discussion group with your friends to discuss each day's problem.
Forward a problem to people you think might enjoy it, and discuss potential solutions with them.
