# README

I used to do some of these daily coding problems, but consistency eventually became a problem.
I have decided to it publicly this time and will write code mainly in Python and JS.
If I find the will, I will also do them in Java, C#, and Ruby
As I will also post the problem, feel free to do them with me!
